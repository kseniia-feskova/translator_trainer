Translator trainer

An application that combines two important features for foreign languages education: translation and practices with words. 
Almost everyone uses Google Translate, but often you have to Google the same word over and over again. The translating itself cannot help you memorize the word and its meaning.
That's why "Translator trainer" saves your translated words and uses them in predefined training exercises.
